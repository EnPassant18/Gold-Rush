* to copy the solutions verbatim from the OpenZeppelin-Solidity repository, we
* recommend that you take a stab at implementing them yourself first, as it will
* aid in your understanding of the code and make the rest of the assignment
* easier. The ERC20 standard is incredibly important in the world of smart
* contract developement, and it is useful to know the code well.
